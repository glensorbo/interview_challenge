# Interview Challenge frontend

You need to create 2 files in root dir:

- .env.development.local
- .env.production.local

in these 2 files you need 2 things:

- REACT_APP_BACKEND_URI = "http://localhost:5000"
- REACT_APP_SOCKET_URI = "ws://localhost:5000"

For production build, change localhost to your hosted domain.
